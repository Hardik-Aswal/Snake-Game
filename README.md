# Snake-Game
This is a DSA project based on the concept of Linked List

The snake game is one of the most popular games on Nokia phones, released in 1998
Today there are over 300 snake-like games just for ios.
We can also build a snake game using the Linked List concept of Data Structures.
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
This game is very similar to singly-linked lists, assuming that the snake head is the linked list tail and the snake tail is the linked list head.
Whenever the snake eats the pay, an extra node is added to its tail, i.e., an extra node is added to the linked list head. The same process continues until the snake hits the boundary or itself.
